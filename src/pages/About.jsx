      <p>
        I’m <strong>Shorooq Abu Zaid</strong>, a Software Engineering student at
        KFUPM with experience in Python, Java, and modern web technologies
        (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React).
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy solving problems, designing intuitive user experiences, and
        building tools that make complex ideas feel simple. I’m especially
        interested in data-driven decision making, financial tools, and
        platforms that create real opportunities for people.

# 🤖 AI Usage Report

## 📌 Overview

This report describes how AI tools were used during the development of the Personal Portfolio Web Application (Assignment 3).
AI was used as a helper for specific questions, debugging, and wording — not as a replacement for my own work or 
understanding.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-5) Used occasionally to:
    - Clarify React or CSS concepts
    - Suggest fixes for bugs
    - Help rephrase parts of the documentation

---

## 🎯 Use Cases
1. Debugging & Error Explanation
- When I ran into errors (for example, layout issues, theme not applying correctly, or forms not behaving as expected), I asked AI to:
    - Explain what the error messages meant
    - Suggest possible causes or fixes
- I then applied and adapted the solutions myself.
2. Small Snippets & Pattern Confirmation
- I used AI to:
    - Confirm the correct way to structure a controlled React form
    - Double-check how to use useState and useEffect
    - Get examples of simple validation checks (e.g., email format)
The final code was written and adjusted by me to fit the project’s structure.
3. Styling Suggestions
- AI was used to:
    - Suggest improvements for glassmorphism styling
    - Recommend better spacing or alignment ideas
- I did not copy full designs; I picked the parts that made sense and integrated them manually.
4. Documentation Support
- AI helped:
    - Clean up the wording for README.md
    - Structure this ai-usage-report.md
- All content was reviewed, edited, and customized by me.

---

## ✅ Benefits
- Helped me understand why certain solutions work, not just what to type.
- Saved time when searching for small syntax or pattern questions.
- Gave inspiration for improving UI details without taking over the design.

---

⚠️ Challenges
- Some suggestions did not match my exact file structure and had to be adjusted.
- I had to be careful not to rely too much on AI and make sure I understood every change.
- Sometimes the AI answer was generic, so I had to test and experiment on my own.

---

## 🔎 Learning Outcomes
- Stronger understanding of:
    - React components and props
    - Basic form validation in React
    - How to structure CSS for themes (light/dark)
- Learned to treat AI as a tool for guidance, not as the main author of the code.
- Practiced reading, modifying, and improving suggested snippets instead of copy-pasting.

---

## ✨ Responsible AI Usage
- AI was used only to assist, not to generate the whole project.
- All AI-assisted parts were:
    - Reviewed carefully
    - Adapted to the project
    - Tested by me
- Final responsibility for code quality and design decisions is my own.
